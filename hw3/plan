use elbow method to redo the clustering (and to find the optimal number of clusters)
plot SSD (??) versus number of clusters

Try silhouette analysis if elbow goes wrong or if there is more time.

GMM: try using BIC

5.

Use the predict_proba in GMM

Use the transform in k-means

PCA: accuracy vs. number of dimensions

folder arrangement:

pima: has all scripts for pima indians
mushrooms: has all scripts for mushrooms <-- Note: there will be duplicate(-ish) scripts
paper: contains the tex, pdf, other files for the paper

clustering1: scripts for initial clustering
clustering2: scripts for clustering after applying pca
clustering3: scripts for clustering to reduce dimension of the data

include why cross validation wasn't used:
Cross-validation was not necessary, since the objective here is not
to produce the best neural network possible, but to rather observe
and analyze the similarities in the neural network performance
based on how the dimensions are reduced. Cross-validation adds an
overcomplication which detracts from the main purpose of these
experiments.
